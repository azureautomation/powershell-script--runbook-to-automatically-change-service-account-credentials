PowerShell Script / Runbook to Automatically Change Service Account Credentials
===============================================================================

            

 

 

This script / runbook can be used to automatically update the credentials of service accounts on remote computers. This can be run as a standalone script or better yet, it can be automated using Azure Hybrid Automation!


 


The script will default to 24-Character complex password, however you can change this value by supplying a value with the -PasswordLength parameter.


 



        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
